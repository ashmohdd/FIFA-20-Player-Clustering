# FIFA-20-Player-Clustering
### Project Scope: 
The scope of this project is centered around the FIFA 20 players dataset. The dataset includes a variety of attributes for each player, such as their skills, playing style, and contributions to the game. The project involves several stages, including data collection and cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and result interpretation. The final deliverables include a comprehensive report detailing the findings from the EDA, the clustering model, and the final results, interpretations, and recommendations. The project also assumes that the dataset is accurate and up-to-date, and that the team has access to the necessary resources to conduct the analysis and clustering.

### Goals: 
The primary goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of the playing styles and contributions of the players in the FIFA 20 dataset. This is achieved by analyzing the dataset and clustering the players based on their attributes. The clusters should help identify patterns and insights into the playersâ€™ styles and contributions. Another key goal is to develop a model that can effectively cluster the players. The model should be robust and able to handle the large number of attributes in the dataset. The results of the clustering should then be evaluated and interpreted to understand the significance of the clusters. Finally, the findings should be presented in a comprehensive report that includes visualizations and explanations to support the findings. The report should be clear and concise, making it easy for others to understand the results and the process used to obtain them.

### Objectives:
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA): The first step is to conduct an EDA on the FIFA 20 players dataset to uncover patterns and insights.
- Develop a model to cluster the players: After the EDA, a model will be developed to cluster the players based on their attributes.
- Evaluate and interpret the results of the clustering model: The results of the clustering model will be evaluated and interpreted to understand the significance of the clusters.
- Present findings in a comprehensive report: The findings from the analysis and clustering will be presented in a comprehensive report with visualizations and explanations.

### Deliverables:
- Exploratory data analysis report: A report detailing the findings from the EDA.
- Clustering model report: A report detailing the clustering model and its results.
- Final report with results, interpretations, and recommendations: A final comprehensive report that includes the results, interpretations, and recommendations based on the analysis and 
   clustering.
- Visualizations and explanations to accompany the reports: Visualizations and explanations will be provided to support the findings in the reports.

### Project Summary:
The FIFA 20 Players Clustering Project involved analyzing a dataset of 18,278 players and 104 features. After data cleaning and processing, exploratory data analysis was conducted, revealing insights such as the top countries producing footballers and the impact of age on player performance. Three clustering techniques (t-SNE, KMeans, and Hierarchical Clustering) were applied to the dataset after applying StandardScaler and PCA. The clusters, primarily based on playing positions, provided insights into player skills and attributes. Despite some overlapping, the clustering was successful and useful for understanding different positions on the football field.
